    <h1>Wake Up to Environmental Hazards to Maternal Health</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When you’re pregnant, your world changes. You are now responsible for not only yourself, but also for a tiny growing human. Every choice you make could potentially affect the health of your baby. Everything from what you eat to which medications you take to where you live can impact your pregnancy and the health of your child.</p>
        <p>But there is another factor that could affect the health of both you and your baby: environmental hazards. From extreme temperatures to particulate matter in the air to toxic chemicals in the water and soil—these factors are all linked to maternal mortality and morbidity.</p>
        <p>From the moment an egg is fertilized, the fetus is under attack from attacks from the outside world. Toxic chemicals in water, soil and air can all make their way into the body of a soon-to-be mother and cause a host of health problems for both her and her developing baby. The placenta doesn't have the same filters as your kidneys and liver, so it's even easier for chemicals to get through.</p>
        <p>In fact, we're only recently beginning to understand how sensitive the mother and fetus are to environmental hazards like extreme temperatures, particulate matter in the air, and toxic chemicals in water and soil—and how these issues are directly related to maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide.</p>
        <p>Various studies have drawn connections between various environmental hazards and maternal health and outcomes. Written by public health experts and environmental scientists, these studies give us insight on how our environment affects soon-to-be mothers around the world.</p>
        <p>These issues are particularly important because they are preventable. As we learn more about how our environment affects maternal health around the world, it's imperative that we continue to advocate for safer environments for pregnant women everywhere.</p>
        <p>The first step is awareness– learn more about this issue here with us today, then learn how you can make a difference in your world and community.</p>

        <h2>Socioeconomic factors</h2>
        <p>These issues are often deeply intertwined with issues related to environmental injustice. It is a well-known fact of life that racial minorities are often given fewer opportunities, fewer resources, and less protection in our society. The same is true of pregnant women.</p>
        <p>When it comes to maternal health and outcomes, there are numerous socioeconomic factors that must be considered. One of the most important is environmental injustice. People of color are often disproportionately located in proximity to areas with high levels of toxic chemical accumulation, air pollution, and water contamination. Furthermore, these people are more often than not at a disadvantage when it comes to moving away from these sites.</p>
        <p>The impact of this reality is that we see higher rates of infant mortality and complications during pregnancy among mothers in low-income areas. This can lead to lifelong developmental delays for their children, as well as long-term health issues for the mothers.</p>
        <p>To ignore a woman’s race is to ignore a significant factor that can impact health outcomes. In fact, the CDC found that black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes than white women.</p>
        <p>Environmental justice scholar Robert Bullard describes a spatial segregation process where people of lower socioeconomic class bear the brunt of the adverse effects of environmental damage. He defines the term "environmental racism" as "racial discrimination in environmental policy-making and the enforcement of regulations and laws; the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste facilities; the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities; and the history of excluding people of color from leadership of the environmental movement."</p>
        <p>Environmental injustice can take many forms. In addition to affecting lower-income communities, it also disproportionately affects indigenous populations. Communities suffering from environmental injustice often face issues related to their health, such as increased rates of lead poisoning or asthma.</p>
        <p>But we can do something about it. By helping people understand how their health is directly related to the environment, we can work towards creating long-term social change and improving the health of all people—especially pregnant women and mothers of color whose lives depend on it.</p>

        <h2>Toxic chemicals</h2>
        <p>Toxic chemicals are all around us.</p>
        <p>With each breath you take, you're inhaling a cocktail of toxic chemicals. And with each bite you eat, you're ingesting them. With every surge of adrenaline, your body is absorbing them.</p>
        <p>Whether it is from air pollution from traffic, or toxic runoff in our water supplies, fertilizers, pesticides, and other agricultural chemicals—to the chemicals we use in our homes and personal care products—toxic chemicals are accumulating in our environment every day.</p>
        <p>These toxins are especially dangerous when it comes to maternal and fetal health. These chemicals easily cross the placenta and can cause effects in the growth of a child, affecting their development as well as mom's health.</p>
        <p>Scientists have shown that prenatal exposure to certain types of these toxic chemicals can cause developmental delays, lower IQ, and even decrease sperm quality in men. A recent study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that there was a positive correlation between blood levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)—chemicals found in industrial products such as fabric protectors—and maternal diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity.</p>
        <p>And it doesn't stop there. These chemicals can also lead to other complications like miscarriage and preterm birth, which are major causes of maternal morbidity and mortality.</p>
        <p>At least 24 different types of toxic pollutants have been identified in amniotic fluid samples collected from pregnant women across the country. And these toxins don't only affect pregnant women; they also can be passed down from generation to generation through epigenetics.</p>
        <p>By knowing what these chemicals are, what they do to your body and how they get into your body we can take steps to decrease exposure and protect ourselves from harm.</p>

        <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
        <p>The effects of air pollution on pregnant women and their babies are far-reaching. From the moment of conception until the day a mother gives birth, the air she breathes has an impact on her and her child's health.</p>
        <p>Major causes include indoor air pollution, household air pollution, and outdoor air pollution. A popular example of indoor air pollution is exposure to tobacco smoke from smoking. Some examples of household air pollution include fumes from cooking on open fires and other fuels (i.e., wood fuel) being burned in the home that produce smoke and other harmful pollutants. One of the most common types of outdoor air pollution is car exhaust from vehicles driving down roads. Other examples include burning fossil fuels for energy in power plants, factories, boilers, furnaces, etc., as well as forest fires.</p>
        <p>Pregnant women are at risk from air pollution because they're breathing for two: their bodies absorb all of the harmful toxins in the air that would normally be released through exhaling. On top of this, their lungs are already taking in more oxygen than normal while they're pregnant. If they live in an area where the air quality is compromised, they may be unable to get enough oxygen through their respiratory system alone. This can lead to serious complications like anemia, which can threaten fetal development and ultimately result in death for both mother and child.</p>
        <p>If she breathes in too much carbon monoxide and particulate matter (PM2.5), she runs the risk of developing any number of disorders related to oxygen deprivation in the womb including: low birth weight babies (LBWs), preterm births (PTBs), miscarriages, and stillbirths. Carbon monoxide and PM2.5 can also increase her chances of developing gestational diabetes or preeclampsia during pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>In many ways, air pollution is like a silent killer: while it can have a major negative impact on the health of everyone exposed to it, pregnant women and their babies are some of the most vulnerable people in society when it comes to potential complications from air pollution.

        <h2>Water contamination</h2>
        <p>Environmental hazards are known to have a direct impact on reproductive health, and water pollution is one of the major ways in which environmental hazards impact human health. Water can be polluted with industrial waste, medical waste, agricultural waste, sewage, plastic littering, pesticides, herbicides and oil spills.</p>
        <p>These contaminants can enter our drinking water through many different sources including agricultural runoff and industrial dumping into rivers or lakes, leaking underground storage tanks which contain gasoline or oil products that seep into soil surrounding homes where they may eventually be absorbed by plants growing nearby (and thus ingested), contamination from mining operations near streams used by residents for their drinking supply etc., sewage spills that pollute nearby groundwater wells due to broken pipes underground which have not yet been repaired or replaced with newer materials.</p>
        <p>A woman's reproductive health can be damaged by the presence of contaminants in their water. When these contaminants cause problems in pregnancy, they can put both the mother and her baby at risk. The presence of endocrine inhibitors, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and other industrial chemicals in water supplies poses a threat to maternal and child health.</p>
        <p>The ways in which water is polluted has a direct impact on the quality of life for pregnant women and their unborn children.</p>

        <h2>Home and Occupational Exposure</h2>
        <h3>Home exposure</h3>
        <p>Pregnant women are exposed to an average of 200 toxic chemicals per day, which is significantly higher than the average for the rest of the population. Most of these chemicals are found in common household products; that means that you can be exposed to them without ever leaving your home.</p>
        <p>In the United States, for example, the government allows hundreds of thousands of chemicals to be used in consumer products without testing their safety first. Many of these products include household cleaners, personal care products (like shampoos or lotions), and even toys. Unfortunately, many of these chemicals can have negative health effects at high enough doses. Some may cause cancer or birth defects; others can affect our hormones or the nervous system; still others can cause reproductive problems or interfere with the development of a fetus or young child.</p>
        <h3>The use of solid cooking fuels</h3>
        <p>The use of solid cooking fuels such as wood, dung or charcoal for cooking poses a number of risks to pregnant women and their babies. Exposure to smoke from these types of fuels can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other respiratory disorders, which are conditions that can increase pregnancy complications such as poor birth outcomes. Solid cooking fuels also contribute to air pollution and climate change. In addition, indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is a major contributor to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which cause about 70 percent of all deaths globally.</p>
        <p>Pregnant women are a particularly vulnerable group when it comes to occupational exposure to toxins and pollution, ranging from lead to mercury to pesticides. Unfortunately, many workplaces do not have policies in place to protect pregnant women or their unborn children from being exposed to these harmful substances. This can lead to higher rates of miscarriage, premature birth, low birth weight, and developmental delays.</p>
        <h3>Occupational exposure</h3>
        <p>The children of mothers who are exposed to occupational pollutants and toxins throughout their pregnancy have a significantly increased risk of developing cognitive disorders and learning disabilities, a new study has found.</p>
        <p>Immigrant women and women of color are most likely to be working in jobs that have a higher risk of exposure to toxins and pollution. They are also more likely to experience pregnancy losses due to these exposures.</p>
        <p>We believe that women should be able to safely work during pregnancy without having to worry about the health of their babies. We therefore need increased workplace regulation that will require businesses with known harmful exposure risks to implement exposure reduction policies for pregnant employees.</p>

        <h2>Biohazards</h2>
        <p>Environmental biohazards, such as malaria and other infectious diseases, can be deadly to women and children. In areas where men are the primary workers outside of the home, they are more likely to come into contact with these biohazards than women. This means that pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of being exposed to these diseases in areas where sanitation is poor.</p>
        <p>We know that substandard sanitary conditions and exposure to disease can result in a weakened immune system, and often lead to miscarriages among pregnant women. These issues are compounded by exposure to environmental factors: contaminated water sources, poor sanitation, exposure to malaria-carrying mosquitos, etc. All of these things contribute to the high rates of infant and child mortality.
        </p>
        <p>Fortunately, these issues can also be solved with some simple solutions: providing clean drinking water for everyone, improving sanitation and hygiene practices across the board, better education about mosquito-borne diseases. We have the opportunity to make great strides in raising healthy families here if only we provide the resources necessary to do so.</p>

        <h2>Climate change</h2>
        <p>Climate change is a public health crisis – one of the most pressing issues facing the world today. It threatens not only our future but our present health, as well. As temperatures rise, shockwaves ripple through our physical, mental, and social environments.</p>
        <p>It's also an issue that's particularly pressing in the realm of maternal health and reproductive outcomes. As temperatures rise and become more erratic, so do birth weights and other pregnancy outcomes.</p>
        <p>As temperatures rise and weather becomes more extreme, pregnant women are more likely to experience health problems like heat exhaustion, dehydration, and heat stroke, as they cannot regulate their body temperature as well as others can due to hormonal changes during pregnancy. Additionally, research has increasingly shown that extreme temperatures have negative effects on pregnancy outcomes such as birth weight, gestational age at birth, fetal death, and stillbirth.</p>
        <p>Women who live in poor communities of color are the most vulnerable to climate change's effects on maternal health and reproductive outcomes.</p>
        <p>What's more, rising sea levels have led to an increase in flooding around the world, which in turn has resulted in a rise in waterborne diseases such as cholera and dengue fever—diseases which have been shown to increase the risk of stillbirths and miscarriages as well as complications during labor.</p>
