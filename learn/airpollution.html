        <h3>Air Pollution</h3>

        <p>The effects of air pollution on pregnant women and their babies are far-reaching. From the moment of conception until the day a mother gives birth, the air she breathes has an impact on her and her child's health.</p>

        <p>Major causes include indoor air pollution, household air pollution, and outdoor air pollution. A popular example of indoor air pollution is exposure to tobacco smoke from smoking. Some examples of household air pollution include fumes from cooking on open fires and other fuels (i.e., wood fuel) being burned in the home that produce smoke and other harmful pollutants. One of the most common types of outdoor air pollution is car exhaust from vehicles driving down roads. Other examples include burning fossil fuels for energy in power plants, factories, boilers, furnaces, etc., as well as forest fires.</p>

        <p>Pregnant women are at risk from air pollution because they're breathing for two: their bodies absorb all of the harmful toxins in the air that would normally be released through exhaling. On top of this, their lungs are already taking in more oxygen than normal while they're pregnant. If they live in an area where the air quality is compromised, they may be unable to get enough oxygen through their respiratory system alone. This can lead to serious complications like anemia, which can threaten fetal development and ultimately result in death for both mother and child.</p>

        <p>If she breathes in too much carbon monoxide and particulate matter (PM2.5), she runs the risk of developing any number of disorders related to oxygen deprivation in the womb including: low birth weight babies (LBWs), preterm births (PTBs), miscarriages, and stillbirths. Carbon monoxide and PM2.5 can also increase her chances of developing gestational diabetes or preeclampsia during pregnancy.
        </p>

        <p>In many ways, air pollution is like a silent killer: while it can have a major negative impact on the health of everyone exposed to it, pregnant women and their babies are some of the most vulnerable people in society when it comes to potential complications from air pollution.
