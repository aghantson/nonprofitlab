        <h3>Biohazards</h3>
        <p>Environmental biohazards, such as malaria and other infectious diseases, can be deadly to women and children. In areas where men are the primary workers outside of the home, they are more likely to come into contact with these biohazards than women. This means that pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of being exposed to these diseases in areas where sanitation is poor.</p>
        <p>We know that substandard sanitary conditions and exposure to disease can result in a weakened immune system, and often lead to miscarriages among pregnant women. These issues are compounded by exposure to environmental factors: contaminated water sources, poor sanitation, exposure to malaria-carrying mosquitos, etc. All of these things contribute to the high rates of infant and child mortality.
        </p>
        <p>Fortunately, these issues can also be solved with some simple solutions: providing clean drinking water for everyone, improving sanitation and hygiene practices across the board, better education about mosquito-borne diseases. We have the opportunity to make great strides in raising healthy families here if only we provide the resources necessary to do so.</p>
