        <h3>Water contamination</h3>

        <p>Environmental hazards are known to have a direct impact on reproductive health, and water pollution is one of the major ways in which environmental hazards impact human health. Water can be polluted with industrial waste, medical waste, agricultural waste, sewage, plastic littering, pesticides, herbicides and oil spills.</p>

        <p>These contaminants can enter our drinking water through many different sources including agricultural runoff and industrial dumping into rivers or lakes, leaking underground storage tanks which contain gasoline or oil products that seep into soil surrounding homes where they may eventually be absorbed by plants growing nearby (and thus ingested), contamination from mining operations near streams used by residents for their drinking supply etc., sewage spills that pollute nearby groundwater wells due to broken pipes underground which have not yet been repaired or replaced with newer materials.</p>

        <p>A woman's reproductive health can be damaged by the presence of contaminants in their water. When these contaminants cause problems in pregnancy, they can put both the mother and her baby at risk. The presence of endocrine inhibitors, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and other industrial chemicals in water supplies poses a threat to maternal and child health.</p>

        <p>The ways in which water is polluted has a direct impact on the quality of life for pregnant women and their unborn children.</p>
