        <h3>Home and Occupational Exposure</h3>
        <h4>Home exposure</h4>
        <p>Pregnant women are exposed to an average of 200 toxic chemicals per day, which is significantly higher than the average for the rest of the population. Most of these chemicals are found in common household products; that means that you can be exposed to them without ever leaving your home.</p>
        <p>In the United States, for example, the government allows hundreds of thousands of chemicals to be used in consumer products without testing their safety first. Many of these products include household cleaners, personal care products (like shampoos or lotions), and even toys. Unfortunately, many of these chemicals can have negative health effects at high enough doses. Some may cause cancer or birth defects; others can affect our hormones or the nervous system; still others can cause reproductive problems or interfere with the development of a fetus or young child.</p>
        <h4>The use of solid cooking fuels</h4>
        <p>The use of solid cooking fuels such as wood, dung or charcoal for cooking poses a number of risks to pregnant women and their babies. Exposure to smoke from these types of fuels can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other respiratory disorders, which are conditions that can increase pregnancy complications such as poor birth outcomes. Solid cooking fuels also contribute to air pollution and climate change. In addition, indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is a major contributor to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which cause about 70 percent of all deaths globally.</p>
        <p>Pregnant women are a particularly vulnerable group when it comes to occupational exposure to toxins and pollution, ranging from lead to mercury to pesticides. Unfortunately, many workplaces do not have policies in place to protect pregnant women or their unborn children from being exposed to these harmful substances. This can lead to higher rates of miscarriage, premature birth, low birth weight, and developmental delays.</p>
        <h4>Occupational exposure</h4>
        <p>The children of mothers who are exposed to occupational pollutants and toxins throughout their pregnancy have a significantly increased risk of developing cognitive disorders and learning disabilities, a new study has found.</p>
        <p>Immigrant women and women of color are most likely to be working in jobs that have a higher risk of exposure to toxins and pollution. They are also more likely to experience pregnancy losses due to these exposures.</p>
        <p>We believe that women should be able to safely work during pregnancy without having to worry about the health of their babies. We therefore need increased workplace regulation that will require businesses with known harmful exposure risks to implement exposure reduction policies for pregnant employees.</p>
