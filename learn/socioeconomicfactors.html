        <h3>Socioeconomic factors</h3>
        <p>These issues are often deeply intertwined with issues related to environmental injustice. It is a well-known fact of life that racial minorities are often given fewer opportunities, fewer resources, and less protection in our society. The same is true of pregnant women.</p>
        <p>When it comes to maternal health and outcomes, there are numerous socioeconomic factors that must be considered. One of the most important is environmental injustice. People of color are often disproportionately located in proximity to areas with high levels of toxic chemical accumulation, air pollution, and water contamination. Furthermore, these people are more often than not at a disadvantage when it comes to moving away from these sites.</p>
        <p>The impact of this reality is that we see higher rates of infant mortality and complications during pregnancy among mothers in low-income areas. This can lead to lifelong developmental delays for their children, as well as long-term health issues for the mothers.</p>

        <p>To ignore a woman’s race is to ignore a significant factor that can impact health outcomes. In fact, the CDC found that black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes than white women.</p>
        <p>Environmental justice scholar Robert Bullard describes a spatial segregation process where people of lower socioeconomic class bear the brunt of the adverse effects of environmental damage. He defines the term "environmental racism" as "racial discrimination in environmental policy-making and the enforcement of regulations and laws; the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste facilities; the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities; and the history of excluding people of color from leadership of the environmental movement."</p>
        <p>Environmental injustice can take many forms. In addition to affecting lower-income communities, it also disproportionately affects indigenous populations. Communities suffering from environmental injustice often face issues related to their health, such as increased rates of lead poisoning or asthma.</p>
        <p>But we can do something about it. By helping people understand how their health is directly related to the environment, we can work towards creating long-term social change and improving the health of all people—especially pregnant women and mothers of color whose lives depend on it.</p>
