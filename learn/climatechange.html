        <h3>Climate change</h3>

        <p>Climate change is a public health crisis – one of the most pressing issues facing the world today. It threatens not only our future but our present health, as well. As temperatures rise, shockwaves ripple through our physical, mental, and social environments.</p>

        <p>It's also an issue that's particularly pressing in the realm of maternal health and reproductive outcomes. As temperatures rise and become more erratic, so do birth weights and other pregnancy outcomes.</p>

        <p>As temperatures rise and weather becomes more extreme, pregnant women are more likely to experience health problems like heat exhaustion, dehydration, and heat stroke, as they cannot regulate their body temperature as well as others can due to hormonal changes during pregnancy. Additionally, research has increasingly shown that extreme temperatures have negative effects on pregnancy outcomes such as birth weight, gestational age at birth, fetal death, and stillbirth.</p>

        <p>Women who live in poor communities of color are the most vulnerable to climate change's effects on maternal health and reproductive outcomes.</p>

        <p>What's more, rising sea levels have led to an increase in flooding around the world, which in turn has resulted in a rise in waterborne diseases such as cholera and dengue fever—diseases which have been shown to increase the risk of stillbirths and miscarriages as well as complications during labor.</p>
