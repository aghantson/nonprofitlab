        <h3>Toxic chemicals</h3>
        <p>Toxic chemicals are all around us.</p>
        <p>With each breath you take, you're inhaling a cocktail of toxic chemicals. And with each bite you eat, you're ingesting them. With every surge of adrenaline, your body is absorbing them.</p>
        <p>Whether it is from air pollution from traffic, or toxic runoff in our water supplies, fertilizers, pesticides, and other agricultural chemicals—to the chemicals we use in our homes and personal care products—toxic chemicals are accumulating in our environment every day.</p>

        <iframe class="video-embed" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vncDYt5wdsY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>These toxins are especially dangerous when it comes to maternal and fetal health. These chemicals easily cross the placenta and can cause effects in the growth of a child, affecting their development as well as mom's health.</p>
        <p>Scientists have shown that prenatal exposure to certain types of these toxic chemicals can cause developmental delays, lower IQ, and even decrease sperm quality in men. A recent study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that there was a positive correlation between blood levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)—chemicals found in industrial products such as fabric protectors—and maternal diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity.</p>

        <p>And it doesn't stop there. These chemicals can also lead to other complications like miscarriage and preterm birth, which are major causes of maternal morbidity and mortality.</p>
        <p>At least 24 different types of toxic pollutants have been identified in amniotic fluid samples collected from pregnant women across the country. And these toxins don't only affect pregnant women; they also can be passed down from generation to generation through epigenetics.</p>
        <p>By knowing what these chemicals are, what they do to your body and how they get into your body we can take steps to decrease exposure and protect ourselves from harm.</p>
